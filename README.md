# Colmar Academy Website

## Project Overview

This project showcases the Colmar Academy website, built as a capstone project for the Codecademy course "Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages." The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the HTML and CSS skills I have acquired throughout the course.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to illustrate my ability to design and develop a responsive and visually appealing website using HTML and CSS. This project serves as a practical application of the concepts and techniques learned during the Codecademy course, culminating in the successful completion of the course and earning a certificate.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Clean and Modern Layout**: The design focuses on a clean and modern aesthetic, with a user-friendly interface and easy navigation.
- **Multiple Sections**: The website includes several sections, such as the header, start section, explore section, learning section, thesis exhibit, and footer, each serving a specific purpose.
- **Media Integration**: The project integrates various media elements, including images and videos, to enhance the user experience.

## Drawbacks

- **Hyperlinks Unusable**: This project has hyperlinks that are not usable due to this website being based on a fictious company.
